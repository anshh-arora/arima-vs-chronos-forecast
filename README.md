### 📊 Models Used:
- Chronos AI (Deep Learning Transformer-based)
- ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average)

## 💡 Key Findings
- ✅ **Chronos AI:** Better long-term forecasting (5 & 10 years) with seasonality.  
- ⚠️ **ARIMA:** Effective for short-term, but flattens for long-term forecasts.
